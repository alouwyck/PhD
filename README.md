The PhD dissertation is structured into 13 chapters:

* Chapter 1 is a general introduction and has no code implemented.
* Chapter 2 presents a generalized semi-analytical solution for multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 2](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter2_generalized_semi_analytical_solution.ipynb)
* Chapter 3 discusses the finite-difference approach to simulate multilayer flow: [MAxSym tool](https://github.com/alouwyck/MAxSym)
* Chapter 4 critically reviews the hybrid finite-difference finite-element method: [Notebook Chapter 4](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter4_critical_review_AS2D.ipynb)
* Chapter 5 develops a semi-analytical solution for multilayer-multizone flow: [Notebook Chapter 5](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter5_multilayer_multizone_flow.ipynb)
* Chapter 6 is about modeling multilayer wells: [Notebook Chapter 6](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter6_multilayer_wells.ipynb)
* Chapter 7 solves some interesting nonlinear problems for multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 7](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter7_two_zone_multiaquifer_systems.ipynb)
* Chapter 8 treats unconfined multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 8](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter7_two_zone_multiaquifer_systems.ipynb)
* Chapter 9 provides a better theoretical understanding of confined multilayer flow to a pumping well: [Notebook Chapter 9](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter9_understanding_radial_flow.ipynb).
* Chapter 10 derives equations for calculating the radius of influence: [Notebook Chapter 10](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter10_radius_of_influence_myth.ipynb)
* Chapter 11 addresses the water budget myth and delves into the distinction between linear and nonlinear models: [Notebook Chapter 11](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter11_water_budget_myth.ipynb)
* Chapter 12 is a practical study optimizing a drainage system using linear programming: [Notebook Chapter 12](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter12_linear_programming.ipynb)
* Chapter 13 concludes and summarizes the thesis and has no code implemented.

Some of the developed models and solutions are collected in the [MAxSyPy](https://github.com/alouwyck/maxsypy) package.

It is not the aim of this PhD research to develop professional software for the general public. The code is written with the only objective to verify the newly developed solutions. It is not always well-documented, and in many cases, it is badly structured. For sure, computational performance of some algorithms can also be enhanced.

The PhD dissertation is structured into 13 chapters:

* Chapter 1 is a general introduction and has no code implemented.
* Chapter 2 presents a generalized semi-analytical solution for multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 2](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter2_generalized_semi_analytical_solution.ipynb)
* Chapter 3 discusses the finite-difference approach to simulating multilayer flow: [MAxSym tool](https://github.com/alouwyck/MAxSym)
* Chapter 4 critically reviews the hybrid finite-difference finite-element method: [Notebook Chapter 4](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter4_critical_review_AS2D.ipynb)
* Chapter 5 develops a semi-analytical solution for multilayer-multizone flow: [Notebook Chapter 5](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter5_multilayer_multizone_flow.ipynb)
* Chapter 6 is about modeling multilayer wells: [Notebook Chapter 6](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter6_multilayer_wells.ipynb)
* Chapter 7 solves some interesting nonlinear problems for multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 7](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter7_two_zone_multiaquifer_systems.ipynb)
* Chapter 8 treats unconfined multilayer flow: [Notebook Chapter 8](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter7_two_zone_multiaquifer_systems.ipynb)
* Chapter 9 provides a better theoretical understanding of confined multilayer flow to a pumping well (Matlab code not available).
* Chapter 10 derives equations for calculating the radius of influence: [Notebook Chapter 10](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter10_radius_of_influence_myth.ipynb)
* Chapter 11 addresses the water budget myth and delves into the distinction between linear and nonlinear models: [Notebook Chapter 11](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter11_water_budget_myth.ipynb)
* Chapter 12 is a practical study optimizing a drainage system using linear programming: [Notebook Chapter 12](https://github.com/alouwyck/PhD/blob/main/chapter12_linear_programming.ipynb)
* Chapter 13 concludes and summarizes the thesis and has no code implemented.
